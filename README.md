# Advent Of Code 2021 
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar that contains different programming puzzles. I thought this challenge would be a great way for me to not only 
make sure I can still code and freshen up my problem solving skills, but also combine two of my favorite things into one - Christmas and coding! 

This repo will contain the source code (coded in Python) of each puzzle.
